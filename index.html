                        <p>
                            I was hired to design and develop a new website for Evt, a technology consulting company in the
                            water and sewage industry. They needed an updated website that fit todays market in design and 
                            functionality, to make it easier to present themselves and what they do to customers.
                            <br><br>
                            Their new website offers inter alia a dedicated page for presenting their earlier project, 
                            with extra focus on some of their most impressive reference projects. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also got a chance to create concepts for a new logo, something they were also looking into.
                            This kind of logotype design is not something that i usually do so it was a great challenge.
                            <br><br>
                            I wanted to capture the identity of the company and hint at the field that the company usually
                            works in with the logo. I therefore designed a logo with a quite simple and industrial font, but
                            with water effects and colors to imitate a water tower and mirror the water industry that Evt
                            work within.

                                This program creates a forestation map based on an input file and runs three different tests.
                                They involve randomizing locations on the map and evaluating how many trees fall into a certain radius from 
                                each random-given locations. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The three tests all use a different radius but the same randomized locations. Two
                                of the tests use a dynamic radius based on a user-given variable and one test a static radius that is given by the user.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Input from the user tells the program hom many randomized locations should be created (samples) and how many times
                                this process should be repeated (replications). The evaluated data is then output to a .csv document.

                                The work consisted of writing several programs in Matlab for the assessments that were needed for the article.
                                The program was made for esitmating an aggregation index,  based on sampling data that is gained from user input,
                                and to estimate the degree of the clumping of forestation landscape based on this gained index.
