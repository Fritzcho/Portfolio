                <h1>The Green Sandwich Take-away App</h1>
                <h2>An assigment from the <i>Design for user experience</i> course</h2>
                <h3>The Green Sandwich take-away app was a group assignment during the <i>Design for user experience</i> course
                    in which we were tasked with creating a logo and app for ordering take-away for the newly opened, conceptual company, The
                    Green Sandwich or <i>Gröna Mackan</i> as it was in Swedish. A vegan café selling only vegan sandwiches and drinks, with focus
                    on the envoirenment and sustainability. The task involved every step of the design-process and the group started with creating 
                    this mood-board.

                <h3>
                    We wanted to create a logo that really was based on the vegan identity of the café that at the same time
                    could give customers the right feelings about their sustainability focus. We settled for this, a coffee cup with
                    a leaf above and of course the company name.

                <h3>
                    For creating the app, we did a lot of wireframing and played around with
                    the different colours from our graphic-profile to get a result that we were statisfied with.
                    We wanted to avoid the colours looking to dark, while also avoiding looking too much like
                    the SubWay colourways. What we finally settled for was the following, and safe to say, we
                    were really happy with the result. The colours, the smooth forms and the icons which 
                    we made sure did not give impressions of any plastic straws or other objects that are not
                    envoirenment-friendly.
